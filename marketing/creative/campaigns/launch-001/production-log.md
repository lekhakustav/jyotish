# Launch 001 video production log

**Campaign:** `cmp_20260716_launch`  
**Purpose:** durable, append-only record of the Jyotish Baje short-form video production work.  
**Canonical prompt source:** [`veo-prompts.md`](veo-prompts.md)  
**Current status:** source-scene generation not yet started in this workspace.  
**Last updated:** 2026-07-18

## How to use this log

- Append new events; do not rewrite history after results are known.
- Record rejected Veo renders as well as accepted renders.
- Never put user-level data, real birth data, private chat, QR payloads, or large media binaries
  in Git.
- Link each claim to evidence: a file path, Drive file ID, checksum, Git SHA, capture record, or
  reviewer decision.
- If a previous entry is wrong, add a correction entry instead of silently editing it.

## Current production objective

Produce the first wave of truthful 9:16 short-form videos using the existing Launch 001 pack:

1. `dia001` — private Kundli QR handoff across distance.
2. `fam001` — family profiles and member-aware Jyotish Baje questions.
3. `nep001` — Nepali/English language switching and readable Nepali UI.
4. `voc001` — voice input with an editable transcript.

`pat001` is the next supporting-retention concept after this wave.

## Decision and event history

### 2026-07-18 — Production conversation started

- **Decision:** Use this Codex conversation plus this repository as the working system for video
  production.
- **Decision:** Preserve the existing Launch 001 prompt pack as canonical.
- **Decision:** Begin with `dia001`, `fam001`, `nep001`, and `voc001`; produce `pat001` next.
- **Decision:** Generate clean Veo source scenes first. Real app footage, voiceover, captions,
  and CTA are added later in the edit.
- **Evidence:** `marketing/creative/campaigns/launch-001/README.md`, `veo-prompts.md`,
  `app-capture-shot-list.md`, and `preflight-checklist.md`.
- **Next action:** Generate at least three Veo seeds for one selected first-wave prompt and
  return the outputs or their local/Drive identifiers for registration.

## Handoff checklist for the next chat

- Read this log and report the last event before doing anything else.
- Check the queue for the first `Not started` or `In progress` item.
- Use the matching canonical prompt from `veo-prompts.md`.
- Ask for or inspect the generated output; do not infer quality from the prompt alone.
- Register every output, including rejects, with provenance and a reason.
- Append the next event and leave a clear next action.
